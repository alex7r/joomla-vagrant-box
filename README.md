# WrapBox
Joomla Vagrant box wrapper for box @ `thealex7r/joomla`
After importing the box webroot is relocated to local `./html/` so you can easily start working with files.

#### How to note:
Don't forget to

`git add` and `git commit` folders that you're planing to work with 

so you can track all changes automatically :)
